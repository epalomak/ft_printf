# ft_printf
This is a school project were you have to recreate frequently used function printf

## How it works
my ft_printf works with following conversions:
- d
- i
- o
- u
- x\X
- c
- p
- s
- f

It also works with basic flags -+0#, and hh,h, l, ll and L
precision and minimum field-with also works.

### How it could be better
It could be optimized better for example doing only one string and then printing it, 
instead of printing little by little.
